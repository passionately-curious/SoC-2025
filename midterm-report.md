# Mid-term report

Project aim is to build a decentralized gambling application.
Before learning to build a decentralized application,
a very good understanding of the technology used to build is very important.  

## Blockchain

So I started with resources given by the mentor:

- [Updraft's blockchain basics course](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/blockchain-basics)
- [Bitcoin white paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf)
- [Ethereum white paper](https://ethereum.org/en/whitepaper/)  
  
I also studied some other things online which were interesting,

- [3blue1brown's bitcoin video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4)
- Building a blockchain from scratch using this [blog](https://hackernoon.com/learn-blockchains-by-building-one-117428612f46) as a reference.  
  
I also made some [notes](./notes/README.md) for blockchain concepts.  
Merkle tress was not detail in the bitcoin white paper
because of which I didn't have clairty and
mentor helped me with this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s7C2KjZ9n2U&t=8s).
  
After this, I learnt how to write smart contracts.  

## Solidity

We had two options to write smart contracts, solidity or rust. Due to solidity's simplicity, solidity was chosen.
I learnt solidity in the [Crypto Zombies site](https://cryptozombies.io/).  
Wrote some basic smart contracts in remix-ide, becuase of its easy environment to test and deploy.  

## Application

With the ability to write some basic smart contracts, focus now shifted towards the app logic and final project implementation.  
Mentor gave us some resources to study math concepts used in casino games.

- [Law of large numbers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers).
- [Gambling mathematics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambling_mathematics).  

I also created a token using this [video](https://youtu.be/8N0lLN26BIE?si=ouT3sisEtzS_nbYz) as reference.  
Mentor also said us to design and write a smart contract for a game or two of our choice which I am yet to do because of spending more time in writing solidity.  
I started studying Gambling mathematics and designing the game.
